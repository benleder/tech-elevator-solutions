-- Write queries to return the following:
-- Make the following changes in the "world" database.

-- 1. Add Superman's hometown, Smallville, Kansas to the city table. The 
-- countrycode is 'USA', and population of 45001. (Yes, I looked it up on 
-- Wikipedia.)

	INSERT INTO city(id, name, countrycode, district, population)
	VALUES (4080, 'Smallville', 'USA', 'Kansas', 45001);

-- 2. Add Kryptonese to the countrylanguage table. Kryptonese is spoken by 0.0001
-- percentage of the 'USA' population.

	-- ### POSTGRES ###
	INSERT INTO countrylanguage(countrycode, language, isofficial, percentage)
	VALUES ('USA', 'Kryptonese', false, 0.0001);

	-- ### SQL SERVER ###
	INSERT INTO countrylanguage(countrycode, language, isofficial, percentage)
	VALUES('USA', 'Kryptonese', 0, 0.0001);

-- 3. After heated debate, "Kryptonese" was renamed to "Krypto-babble", change 
-- the appropriate record accordingly.

	UPDATE countrylanguage
	SET language = 'Krypto-babble'
	WHERE language = 'Kryptonese';

-- 4. Set the US captial to Smallville, Kansas in the country table.

	UPDATE country
	SET capital = 4080
	WHERE code = 'USA';

-- 5. Delete Smallville, Kansas from the city table. (Did it succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM city
	WHERE id = 4080;

	-- This DELETE statement fails because the "capital" column of the country 
	-- table is a foreign key constraint

-- 6. Return the US captial to Washington.

	UPDATE country
	SET capital = 3813
	WHERE code = 'USA';

-- 7. Delete Smallville, Kansas from the city table. (Did it succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM city
	WHERE id = 4080;

	-- It works this time because there are no foreign key references to 
	-- this row

-- 8. Reverse the "is the official language" setting for all languages where the
-- country's year of independence is within the range of 1800 and 1972 
-- (exclusive). 
-- (590 rows affected)

	UPDATE countrylanguage
	SET isofficial = NOT isofficial
	WHERE countrycode IN 
	(
		SELECT code 
		FROM country
		WHERE indepyear BETWEEN 1801 AND 1971
	);

-- 9. Convert population so it is expressed in 1,000s for all cities. (Round to
-- the nearest integer value greater than 0.)
-- (4068 rows affected)

	UPDATE city
	SET population = ceiling(population / 1000)
	WHERE population > 0;

-- 10. Assuming a country's surfacearea is expressed in miles, convert it to 
-- meters for all countries where French is spoken by more than 20% of the 
-- population.
-- (7 rows affected)

	UPDATE country
	SET surfacearea = surfacearea * 1609.344
	WHERE code IN 
	(
		SELECT countrycode
		FROM countrylanguage
		WHERE language = 'French' AND percentage >= 20
	);

-- The following changes are applied to the "pagila" database.**

-- 1. Add actors, Hampton Avenue, and Lisa Byway to the actor table.

	INSERT INTO actor(first_name, last_name)
	VALUES ('HAMPTON', 'AVENUE');
	INSERT INTO actor(first_name, last_name)
	VALUES ('LISA', 'BYWAY');

-- 2. Add "Euclidean PI", "The epic story of Euclid as a pizza delivery boy in 
-- ancient Greece", to the film table. The movie was released in 2008 in English. 
-- Since its an epic, the run length is 3hrs and 18mins. There are no special 
-- features, the film speaks for itself, and doesn't need any gimmicks.	

	INSERT INTO film (title, description, release_year, language_id, length)
	VALUES ('EUCLIDEAN PI', 'The epic story of Euclid as a pizza delivery boy in ancient Greece', 2008, (SELECT language_id FROM language WHERE name='English'), 198);

-- 3. Hampton Avenue plays Euclid, while Lisa Byway plays his slightly 
-- overprotective mother, in the film, "Euclidean PI". Add them to the film.

	INSERT INTO film_actor(actor_id, film_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT actor_id FROM actor WHERE first_name='HAMPTON' AND last_name='AVENUE'), (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI'));
	INSERT INTO film_actor(actor_id, film_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT actor_id FROM actor WHERE first_name='LISA' AND last_name='BYWAY'), (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI'));

-- 4. Add Mathmagical to the category table.

	INSERT INTO category(name)
	VALUES ('Mathmagical');

-- 5. Assign the Mathmagical category to the following films, "EUCLIDEAN PI", 
-- "EGG IGBY", "KARATE MOON", "RANDOM GO", and "YOUNG LANGUAGE"

	INSERT INTO film_category(film_id, category_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI'), (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical'));
	INSERT INTO film_category(film_id, category_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EGG IGBY'), (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical'));
	INSERT INTO film_category(film_id, category_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='KARATE MOON'), (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical'));
	INSERT INTO film_category(film_id, category_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='RANDOM GO'), (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical'));
	INSERT INTO film_category(film_id, category_id)
	VALUES ((SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='YOUNG LANGUAGE'), (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical'));

	-- Alternative

	UPDATE film_category SET category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name = 'Mathmagical')
	WHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title IN ('Euclidean PI', 'EGG IGBY', 'KARATE MOON', 'RANDOM GO', 'YOUNG LANGUAGE'))
	
-- 6. Mathmagical films always have a "G" rating, adjust all Mathmagical films 
-- accordingly.
-- (5 rows affected)

	UPDATE film
	SET rating = 'G'
	WHERE film_id IN 
	(
		SELECT film_id 
		FROM film_category
		WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical')
	);
	
-- 7. Add a copy of "Euclidean PI" to all the stores.
	
	INSERT INTO inventory(film_id, store_id) SELECT (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI'), store_id FROM store;

	-- The solution relies on the fact you can INSERT INTO with a SELECT FROM

-- 8. The Feds have stepped in and have impounded all copies of the pirated film, 
-- "Euclidean PI". The film has been seized from all stores, and needs to be 
-- deleted from the film table. Delete "Euclidean PI" from the film table. 
-- (Did it succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM film
	WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI';

	-- This DELETE statement fails because the "film_id" column of the film_actor 
	-- table is a foreign key constraint

-- 9. Delete Mathmagical from the category table. 
-- (Did it succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM category
	WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical');

	-- This DELETE statement fails because the "category_id" column of the film_category 
	-- table is a foreign key constraint

-- 10. Delete all links to Mathmagical in the film_category tale. 
-- (Did it succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM film_category
	WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical');

	-- THis DELETE statement succeeded since there were no comflicting constraints.
	-- All 5 rows added earlier were deleted.

-- 11. Retry deleting Mathmagical from the category table, followed by retrying
-- to delete "Euclidean PI". 
-- (Did either deletes succeed? Why?)

	DELETE FROM category
	WHERE category_id = (SELECT category_id FROM category WHERE name='Mathmagical');

	-- This DELETE succeeded since the category_id column constraint on file_category
	-- had been removed.

	DELETE FROM film
	WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI';

	-- This DELETE statement failed once again because the "film_id" column of 
	-- the film_actor table is a foreign key constraint.

-- 12. Check database metadata to determine all constraints of the film id, and 
-- describe any remaining adjustments needed before the film "Euclidean PI" can 
-- be removed from the film table.

	-- The film_actor table has a foreign key constraint on film_id which may 
	-- prevent the film from being removed.
	-- The film_category table has a foreign key constraint on film_id which may 
	-- prevent the film from being removed.
	-- The inventory table has a similar constraint on film_id, and may keep the
	-- film fron being deleted.
	-- So, "Euclidean PI" cannot be deleted from the film table until all 
	-- references to its film_id are gone from from both the film_actor and 
	-- inventory tables.
	--
	-- Run the following SQL to resolve the constraints and delete "Euclidean PI".

	DELETE FROM film_actor
	WHERE film_actor.film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI');

	DELETE FROM film_category
	WHERE film_category.film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI');

	DELETE FROM inventory
	WHERE inventory.film_id = (SELECT film_id FROM film WHERE title='EUCLIDEAN PI');

	DELETE FROM film
	WHERE film.title = 'EUCLIDEAN PI';
